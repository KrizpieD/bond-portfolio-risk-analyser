notes:
- leveraged my existing knowledge of springboot/PostgreSQL to set up
- start.spring.io (Spring's official project starter)
- designed/coded bond/portfolio controller/service/model/dao independently
- implemented DB per my design (based off of requirement doc)
- utilized AI to
  - learn more about Bonds
  - quickly get powerful metrics gathering algorithms for them
  - generate sample datasets with realistic attributes
  - tweak algorithm to take advantage of available data (coupon dates)
- (link to youtube videos here)

potential improvements:
- bond description/title inclusion instead of just ISIN
- support for other currencies
- add swagger ui for faster prototyping/testing
- spring cloud profiles for multi-environment deployment
- dockerization for quick deployment
- new tables for historical retention of metrics
